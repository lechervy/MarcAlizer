Package containing generic kernels on vectors.

<p>Kernel are designed to work on generic types. In other words, a Kernel<T extends MyType>
shall work on all subclasses of MyType. This is very convenient in two ways.<br />
First, very generic kernels are allowed. For instance a Kernel<T extends MLVector> will work
for all vectors, whatever thetype of the backing array.
Second, since a kernel machine does not need to know the type the kernel is working on, very
generic kernel machines can easily be built.
